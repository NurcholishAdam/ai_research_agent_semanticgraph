## 🚀 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Automatic Integration (Recommended)
```python
# Context engineering automatically integrated
from agent.research_agent import create_agent

agent = create_agent()
result = agent.invoke({
    "research_question": "Your research question",
    "session_id": "unique_session_id"
})

# Context orchestration results in result["context_orchestration"]
```

### 2. Direct Context Orchestration
```python
from context_engineering import ContextOrchestrator, ResearchContext

orchestrator = ContextOrchestrator()
research_context = ResearchContext(
    question="Your research question",
    quality_requirements=0.8,
    user_preferences={}
)

result = orchestrator.orchestrate_research_context(research_context)
```

### 3. Analytics & Monitoring
```python
# Get comprehensive analytics
analytics = orchestrator.get_orchestration_analytics()
print(f"Performance: {analytics['quality_distribution']['average_quality']}")
```
