```

## 📈 Expected Scaling Patterns

Based on cognitive science and AI research, we expect:

### 🚀 Super-Linear Scaling (b > 1.0)
- **Compute × Hypothesis Quality**: More compute enables deeper reasoning
- **Memory × Knowledge Integration**: Larger memory enables qualitative improvements
- **Context × Cross-Domain Insights**: Larger context reveals hidden connections

### ➡️ Linear Scaling (b ≈ 1.0)
- **Time × Research Depth**: More time proportionally improves thoroughness
- **Research Complexity × Analysis Quality**: Linear relationship expected

### 📉 Sub-Linear Scaling (0 < b < 1.0)
- **Tool Count × Efficiency**: Coordination overhead limits scaling
- **Data Volume × Discovery Rate**: Information overload effects
- **Agent Count × Performance**: Communication overhead at scale

## 🔍 Interpreting Results

### Power Law Exponents
- **b > 1.2**: Strong super-linear scaling → **Invest heavily**
- **0.8 < b < 1.2**: Near-linear scaling → **Scale proportionally**
- **0.3 < b < 0.8**: Diminishing returns → **Optimize efficiency**
- **b < 0.3**: Weak scaling → **Consider alternatives**

### Correlation Strength
- **R² > 0.8**: Very strong relationship → **High confidence**
- **0.6 < R² < 0.8**: Strong relationship → **Reliable for planning**
- **0.4 < R² < 0.6**: Moderate relationship → **Use with caution**
- **R² < 0.4**: Weak relationship → **Needs more data**

## 💡 Practical Applications

### 1. Resource Allocation Optimization
```python
# Allocate budget based on scaling exponents
high_impact_dimensions = [law for law in scaling_laws if law.power_law_exponent > 1.0]
for dimension in high_impact_dimensions:
    allocate_more_budget(dimension.scaling_dimension)
```

### 2. Performance Prediction
```python
# Predict performance at 2x compute resources
current_performance = 0.7
scaling_exponent = 1.2
predicted_performance = current_performance * (2.0 ** scaling_exponent)
# Result: 0.7 * 2.3 = 1.61 (130% improvement!)
```

### 3. Bottleneck Identification
```python
# Find performance bottlenecks
bottlenecks = [law for law in scaling_laws if law.power_law_exponent < 0.5]
for bottleneck in bottlenecks:
    optimize_efficiency(bottleneck.scaling_dimension)
```
